# Single Login System - Test Plan & Implementation

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### 1. **Updated UserLoginScreen**
- **Smart Post-Login Routing**: Now checks `user_metadata.user_type` after successful login
- **Artist Detection**: If `user_type === 'artist'` → navigates to `ArtistBookings`
- **User Default**: If `user_type === 'user'` or undefined → navigates to intended destination
- **Updated Title**: Changed from "USER LOGIN" to "LOGIN" 
- **Simplified Menu**: Removed "Artist Login" from menu options

### 2. **Updated App.tsx Navigation**
- **Removed Conditional Artist Screen**: ArtistBookings is now always available in stack
- **Simplified Navigation**: No more complex conditional rendering for artist screens
- **Removed ArtistLogin Route**: No longer needed

### 3. **HomeScreen Already Ready**
- ✅ **Single Login Button**: Already shows "Log In" for guests
- ✅ **AuthContext Integration**: Uses `useAuth()` hook for user state
- ✅ **Dynamic Menu**: Shows "Log Out" for authenticated users

## 🧪 **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Regular User Login**
```
1. Open app (logged out state)
2. Menu should show: Gallery, Promotions, Book Appointment, Chat, Log In
3. Tap "Log In" → UserLoginScreen opens
4. Enter user credentials (user_type: 'user')
5. Successful login → Should navigate to Home
6. Menu should now show: Gallery, Promotions, Book Appointment, Chat, Log Out
```

### **Test 2: Artist Login**
```
1. Open app (logged out state) 
2. Menu should show: Gallery, Promotions, Book Appointment, Chat, Log In
3. Tap "Log In" → UserLoginScreen opens
4. Enter artist credentials (user_type: 'artist')
5. Successful login → Should navigate directly to ArtistBookings
6. Artist can access their booking management interface
```

### **Test 3: Login Persistence**
```
1. Log in as either user or artist
2. Close app completely
3. Reopen app → Should stay logged in
4. Menu should show "Log Out" button
5. Logout → Menu should show "Log In" button
```

## 🎯 **Expected Console Logs**

### **User Login:**
```
🔐 User logged in with type: user
LOG  Login Successful, Welcome back!
```

### **Artist Login:**
```
🔐 User logged in with type: artist  
LOG  Login Successful, Welcome, artist!
```

## 🔍 **Implementation Details**

### **Smart Routing Logic:**
```typescript
const userType = result.data.user?.user_metadata?.user_type || 'user';
console.log('🔐 User logged in with type:', userType);

if (userType === 'artist') {
  Alert.alert('Login Successful', 'Welcome, artist!');
  navigation.navigate('ArtistBookings');
} else {
  Alert.alert('Login Successful', 'Welcome back!');
  navigation.navigate(returnTo);
}
```

### **Benefits Achieved:**
- ✅ **Single Login Entry Point**: One "Log In" button across all screens
- ✅ **Automatic Role Detection**: System determines user type post-authentication
- ✅ **Simplified UX**: Users don't need to choose their role before logging in
- ✅ **Clean Code**: Removed duplicate ArtistLoginScreen
- ✅ **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more user types (admin, manager, etc.)

## 📱 **User Experience Flow**

```
Guest State:
├── Sees "Log In" button in menu
├── Taps "Log In" 
├── Enters credentials on single login screen
├── System authenticates and checks user type
├── Routes to appropriate screen based on role
└── Menu updates to show "Log Out"

Logged In State:
├── Sees "Log Out" button in menu  
├── App remembers login between sessions
├── User accesses features based on their role
└── Can log out to return to guest state
```

## 🎯 **Current Status: Ready for Testing**

The single login system is now implemented and ready for testing. The app should:
1. Show single "Log In" button for guests
2. Route users based on their account type after login
3. Maintain clean, intuitive user experience
4. Work with existing login persistence system
