// Test notification navigation fix
// This file can be used to test that clicking "View" on artist notifications
// now takes them to the Chat screen instead of staying on the dashboard

console.log('ðŸ§ª Testing notification navigation fix...');

// The fix implemented:
// 1. Changed App.tsx navigation callback to route "dashboard" destination to "Chat" screen
// 2. Updated NotificationService.ts log messages to reflect the new behavior
// 3. Artists now see chat overview with unread message indicators instead of staying on dashboard

console.log('âœ… Expected behavior:');
console.log('- Artist receives generic "New Message" notification');
console.log('- Clicking "View" navigates to Chat screen');
console.log('- Chat screen shows conversation list with orange borders for unread messages');
console.log('- No more confusion about notifications not doing anything');

console.log('ðŸ“± To test: Send a message from user to artist, then click "View" on the notification');
